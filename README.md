## Description

The **Memory Management Examples** repository demonstrates key memory management concepts implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. The goal is to provide clear, visual, and interactive examples of how memory is managed in an operating system, with a focus on the following concepts:

- **Segmentation**: Dividing memory into variable-sized blocks.
- **Memory Allocation**: Implementing allocation strategies such as **First-fit**, **Best-fit**, and **Worst-fit**.
- **Swapping**: Managing processes in limited memory spaces.
- **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**: A cache to speed up virtual memory access.
- **Pagination**: Implementing page tables and a paging system.

This project is designed for anyone learning about memory management or those looking to simulate memory management techniques in Python.

## Requirements

To run the examples, you need python >= 3.10 and the required dependencies installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lorenzomaiuri-dev/memory-management-examples.git
    cd memory-management-examples
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
3. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

You can explore the concepts interactively by running the Jupyter notebooks\
Hereâ€™s a list of Jupyter notebooks you can run to see the different memory management strategies in action:

- **segmentation.ipynb:** simulates memory allocation using segmentation. This simulation models physical memory, allocates segments for processes, and displays the memory allocation
- **swapping_FIFO.ipynb:** simulates swapping, a memory management technique where an entire process is moved between memory and disk (secondary storage). This simulation includes the concepts of physical memory, a "swap area" (disk), and process swapping.
- **allocation.ipynb:** simulates First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit allocation algorithms for dynamic memory allocation. This simulation implement and compare these memory allocation strategies for managing free memory blocks in a contiguous memory system
- **pagination.ipynb:** simulates pagination and the FIFO page replacement policy
- **TLB.ipynb:** simulates how a TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) caches virtual-to-physical address mappings to speed up address translation
